TODO:
    Display the number of followers the user has, as well as the number of people that the user follows.
    Display all of the posts for that user, in reverse chronological order.
    For any other user who is signed in, this page should also display a “Follow” or “Unfollow” button that will
        let the current user toggle whether or not they are following this user’s posts. Note that this only
        applies to any “other” user: a user should not be able to follow themselves.
